SettlersOfCatan

 - Trevor Moore

Settlers of Catan is a popular board game where you build settlements and roads while gathering resources to trade to other players.
This project is meant to simulate the popular board game using Java. 
Note that any Java version (8+) should work without any problems.
To start, run the Main.java and it will boot the game up.

In this specific simulation there are 4 players that are to be played cooperatively (same computer). 
Each player starts their turn with the ability to choose their settlement and road.
From there, the game plays just like regular Settlers.
